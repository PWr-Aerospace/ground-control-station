## Development

In order to locally run development versions and build your own follow these steps to setup your local environment:

1. Install rust following instructions on the official web page: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>
2. Install `node` and `npm`, node has to be at least version 16
3. Install the `tauri` project management plugin for `cargo` (this will take a while):

    ```bash
    cargo install tauri-cli
    ```

4. Install the local JS server `vite` using npm

    ```bash
    npm install vite
    ```

5. If you are on `Ubuntu` install these packages using `apt`:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get install -y libgtk-3-dev webkit2gtk-4.0 libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libudev-dev
    ```

6. Now you should be capable of building the application. Navigate to the root
of the cloned repository and run:

    For a development build:

    ```bash
    cargo tauri dev
    ```

    For release build (that will create an installer for your operating system):

    ```bash
    cargo tauri build
    ```

7. If your build failed saying that tsc is not a known command you have to explicitly
    install typescript by running:

    ```bash
    npm install -g typescript
    ```
